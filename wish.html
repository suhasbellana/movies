  <h1>Wish</h1>
  <p>King Magnifico and his wife Queen Amaya establish the kingdom of Rosas on an island in the Mediterranean Sea. Having studied sorcery, Magnifico is able to grant the greatest desires of his subjects; each of them give up the memory of their wishes to be sealed and protected by the king until he can grant them. Once in a month, as a ceremonial event, Magnifico chooses one wish to be granted.

    17-year-old Asha prepares to interview for the job of Magnifico's apprentice on the day of her grandfather Sabino's 100th birthday, hoping Magnifico will grant Sabino's wish. The interview goes well until Asha requests for Sabino's wish to be granted, which Magnifico declines, seeing the wish's elusiveness as a potential threat to his power. Asha realizes Magnifico never intends to return the ungranted wishes to their owners, and when she questions his methods, Magnifico refuses to accept her apprenticeship or grant any of her family members' wishes.
    
    Asha tries but fails to convince her family that Magnifico is deceiving them. Distraught, she makes her own wish on a star. To her surprise, the star descends from the sky in a form of an anthropomorphic ball of light, which Asha names Star. Star's magic gives the forest animals, including Asha's pet goat Valentino, the ability to talk, prompting Asha to enlist Star's help in retrieving her family's wishes. Star's presence is sensed by everyone in the kingdom, and Magnifico feels threatened by it. Despite Amaya's pleas, he turns to forbidden magic to maintain his position of power as his subjects begin to doubt his way of ruling.
    
    Asha retrieves Sabino's wish and he is overjoyed to be able to remember it, but Magnifico arrives to arrest them, having been informed that Asha was responsible for Star's summoning. Corrupted by the dark magic, Magnifico intends to use Star's magic and Rosas' wishes to increase his own powers, forcing Asha's family to flee to a nearby island, while Asha, Star, and Valentino stay behind to free the other citizens' wishes. One of Asha's friends, Simon, is revealed to be the one who sold Asha out to Magnifico in hopes of his wish to become a knight will be granted. Magnifico grants the wish, but additionally bewitches Simon into being his henchman in capturing Asha.
    
    Asha rallies her other friends, Dahlia, Bazeema, Dario, Gabo, Hal, and Safi. Amaya also joins them, having discovered Magnifico's corruption. While her friends infiltrate Magnifico's study and open up the ceiling to free the wishes, Asha tries to distract Magnifico, only to be tricked by a disguised Simon. Magnifico ascends the castle's tower, absorbing the power of every wish and trapping Star. Asha attempts to stop him but is easily overpowered as Magnifico blocks the sky, preventing the citizens from wishing on stars.
    
    Asha encourages the citizens to make a wish about changing Rosas' future. The strength of their collective desire eventually overpowers Magnifico, trapping him in his staff's mirror, and the citizens reobtain their sealed wishes with a newfound appreciation of pursuing them.
    
    Amaya imprisons Magnifico and becomes the sole ruler of Rosas, helping the citizens make their wishes come true on their own. A regretful Simon is forgiven by Asha and her friends. Star gifts Asha with a magic wand so that she can continue inspiring people to keep dreaming before returning to the sky among the other stars.</p>
